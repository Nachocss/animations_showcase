# Animations showcase

This is a showcase of animations done with the *Flare library* and its animation editor *rive.app*. It is developed following the BLoC pattern.

## Setting your own animations.

If you are intended to clone this repository for adding your own animations, you will need to place the files into the _assets_ folder and modify _animationsCollection.json_, also included in the _assets_ folder.

## This is currently in development.
In case you fork this repository before Unit tests are passing, you will have to add your animation data directly into _animations-list.dart_
